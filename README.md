# Lasciami dire
This is a **WIP** Project for a Complete Web Platform intended to ease communication between Child, Parent and Educator in subjects with complex necessities.
## Method
This will be achieved by building on top of the [AAC System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication) in an Integrated and Open approach to development meant to give freedom to the end users as well as reliability in a complete system.

The interface will be split in three major distinct sections:
* Child
* Parent
* Educator

From which to perform different actions with the Child accessing the communication, the Parent the building blocks of such communication and the Educator a more specific function set.

The Visual Hierarchy will be vertical with the Child being the base, the Parent having access to the Child's functions and the Educator to most of the Parent's functions.

The Data and Relations between Children, Parents and Educators will be synced using a Database.

## Styling
The Style of the Project should be Simple and Intuitive.

The most important source of inspiration we currently have is the [Gnome HIG](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/index.html).

## Why Open Source
We believe that Software should be Public for that is the best solution to grant the End Users the most Comfort, Safety and Liberty.

It ensures that this Project will have the possibility of being supported even if we, at some point, cannot continue to do so.
